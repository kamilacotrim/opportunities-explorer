# Atomic Universe


I built this project to help students to create
big things with a small beginning.<br>

I'm a developer from Brazil, and I'm constantly bothered by the fate of 
opportunities to a selected group in my country without a deep exploration of human capabilities.

When I asked for help to find my way, I felt like I was living the life of their minds, so I accepted that only I could recognize because it's part of me.<br> 
I hope that every project raises this part of you.
