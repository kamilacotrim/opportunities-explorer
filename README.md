# Atomic Universe

I built this project to help students to create
big things with a small beginning.


I'm a developer from Brazil, and I'm constantly bothered by the fate of 
opportunities to a selected group in my country without a deep exploration of human capabilities.

The first page, called College Map is to encourage an open vision of education.
The second page, Data-bank, is for beginners data scientists like me who need direction.
The last page, AI-builder, is for everyone that needs money to pay for an AI service.


On the first page, I got an Excel file from the US Department of Education to display colleges and universities available for each degree.
On the second, I went to the Open Science Framework website and worked with their API
On the last, I work with TensorFlow API.


I learned how to work with APIs when I need to face them.
